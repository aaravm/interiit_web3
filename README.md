This is a fully functional chess game, where users play the game by dragging and dropping the pieces. The users are prompted to add each move to the blockchain via metamask.
Users have to input the back and the white players addresses. After one user manages to checkmate the other, the game over screen is prompted, and the winner of the game is given an NFT.<br>
The Frontend is made using chess.js and chessboard.js, with standard functions doing the heavylifting. Then, I have made a solidity contract with struct for each move, an array of structs for storing the game, and a setter and getter. I integrated it with react using ABI and contract Address using standard codes. Then, I made another solidity contract, where each time the mint function is called, the contract mints a new NFT using the _mint function. THe function is given the address of the winner, and it transfers the minted NFT into the MetaMask wallet of the winner.
